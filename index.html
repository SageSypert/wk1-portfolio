    <h2 class="heading">What I Dig</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>History. Especially if it has to do with the World Wars or the Middle East.</li>
      <li>Documentaries. About anything!</li>
      <li>Diving into a good podcast or book. Any recommendations?</li>
      <li>Making and listening to music of all kinds.</li>
      <li>Animal rescue. Watch out for all the dog hair. Sorry!</li>
      <li>Weird art, photography, and art history. Think George Condo and Tadanori Yokoo.</li>
      <li>Social Justice. <em><strong><span class="blm">Black Lives Matter</span></strong></em></li>
    </ul>
